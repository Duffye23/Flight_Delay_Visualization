# Flight_Delay_Visualization

Following our previous project, where we created a dataframe to view a large set of flight data to try and determine if the data contained a predictor for a given flight's delay. 
You can see that project here: https://github.com/ggiudice98/Project1 </br>

For this project, we decided to use the same dataset, but this time we are visualizing the delays with the aid oh a python-made API, javascript to create our visualizations, and a HTLM coding to house the visuals. We do this to the answer the question: Given our January data set, how do the different elements presented in the data set affect a given flightâ€™s departure time? </br>

For our visualizations, we chose to create a map with our airports acting as markers, and then have their corresponding delays and filters appear on the map accoridng to the total amount. This would helpus understand the size and severity of the delays and let us answer our main question.
